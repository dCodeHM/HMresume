----------------------Website Information----------------------
Hello I'm Niel.

This website is for my personal use to display the necessary information about myself, projects created, introduction, motifs, and for applying jobs. I do not have any protection against but the respect incase the code that I have created has been leaked to the public.

Thank you.

To create my resume website, I have used HTML and Tailwind CSS. For future developement, I will also include or update my websites and add additional project websites in the near future.
